```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@radix-ui/react-tabs": "^1.0.4",
    "@radix-ui/react-checkbox": "^1.0.4",

```

Then run:
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Environment Variables

Add these new environment variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Webhooks (Optional - for real-time sync)
AFFINITY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
NOTION_WEBHOOK_URL=your_notion_webhook_url_here

# Performance Settings (Optional)
RATE_LIMIT_CALLS_PER_SECOND=3
MAX_SYNC_DURATION=300000
AUTO_CLEANUP_ENABLED=true

# Monitoring (Optional)
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your_slack_webhook_for_alerts
ALERT_EMAIL=admin@yourcompany.com

### 5. Database Migration

**CRITICAL**: Run this BEFORE deploying:

```bash
# Backup your current database first
pg_dump your_database_name > backup_before_v2.sql

# Run the migration
psql your_database_name < database/migrations/002_enhanced_features.sql
```

### 6. Git Upload Process

Make the upload script executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x git-upload.sh
./git-upload.sh
```

Or run the commands manually:

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/enhanced-sync-v2

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit with comprehensive message
git commit -m "feat: Enhanced sync system v2.0 with monitoring and webhooks

### 10. Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] **Database backup completed**
- [ ] **Migration script tested on staging**
- [ ] **Environment variables updated**
- [ ] **Dependencies installed** (`npm install`)
- [ ] **Application builds successfully** (`npm run build`)
- [ ] **Health endpoint accessible** (`GET /api/health`)
- [ ] **Existing sync pairs still functional**
- [ ] **Team notified of new features**

### 11. Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health

# Check metrics endpoint  
curl https://your-domain.com/api/metrics

# Verify existing sync pairs
curl https://your-domain.com/api/sync-pairs
```

### 12. Training Your Team

New features to show your team:

1. **Health Dashboard** - Monitor all sync pairs at `/api/metrics`
2. **Bulk Conflict Resolution** - Handle multiple conflicts efficiently
3. **Real-time Sync** - Set up webhooks for instant updates
4. **Data Quality Reports** - Regular analysis of field quality
5. **Performance Metrics** - Track sync speed and reliability

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **Backup First**: Always backup your database before migration
- **Test Staging**: Run migration on staging environment first
- **Backward Compatible**: v2.0 won't break existing functionality
- **Monitor Health**: Watch the health dashboard after deployment
- **Team Training**: Introduce new features gradually

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Migration Issues:**
```bash
# Check migration status
\dt+ *metrics*
\dt+ *alerts*
```

**Performance Issues:**
```bash
# Check performance stats
curl https://your-domain.com/api/metrics
```

**Webhook Issues:**
```bash
# Test webhook endpoints
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/webhooks/affinity \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": true}'
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know the upgrade worked when:

- ✅ Health dashboard shows sync pair scores
- ✅ Bulk conflict resolution interface appears
- ✅ Sync operations are noticeably faster
- ✅ Data quality reports are generated
- ✅ Performance metrics are being tracked
- ✅ Webhooks (if configured) trigger instant syncs

**Your VC team now has an enterprise-grade sync tool! 🎉**
