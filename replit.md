- **API Design**: RESTful API with JSON responses
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage (connect-pg-simple)

### Development Setup
- **Hot Reload**: Vite HMR for frontend, tsx for backend development
- **Development Server**: Express serves both API and static files
- **Build Process**: Vite builds frontend, esbuild bundles backend
- **TypeScript**: Shared types between frontend and backend via `shared/` directory

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses four main tables:
- **users**: User authentication and management
- **sync_pairs**: Configuration for sync relationships between Affinity lists and Notion databases
- **sync_history**: Audit log of synchronization attempts and results
- **conflicts**: Records of data conflicts requiring manual resolution

### External Service Integration
- **Affinity Service**: Handles communication with Affinity CRM API for lists, entries, and field values
- **Notion Service**: Manages Notion API integration for databases and pages
- **Sync Service**: Orchestrates bidirectional synchronization with conflict detection and scheduled syncing

### Frontend Components
- **Dashboard**: Main interface showing sync pairs, conflicts, and system status
- **Sync Configuration Modal**: Interface for creating and editing sync pairs
- **Conflict Resolution Modal**: UI for resolving data conflicts between systems
- **API Settings**: Configuration and monitoring of external API connections

## Data Flow

1. **Sync Pair Creation**: Users configure sync relationships between Affinity lists and Notion databases
2. **Scheduled Synchronization**: Background cron jobs execute syncs based on configured frequency
3. **Conflict Detection**: System identifies data conflicts when both systems have changed the same field
4. **Manual Resolution**: Users review and resolve conflicts through the web interface
5. **Audit Trail**: All sync operations are logged with detailed history and metrics

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party APIs
- **Affinity CRM API**: For accessing lists, entries, and field data
- **Notion API**: For reading and writing database pages and properties

- Implemented comprehensive safety measures to prevent ANY deletion of Affinity entries
- Added multiple layers of protection in both sync service and Affinity service
- Bidirectional sync functionality enabled with strict Affinity protection
- Investigated Affinity API v2 field update endpoints - currently not available
- Tested endpoints: `/v2/lists/{listId}/list-entries/{listEntryId}/actions` and `/field-values/{fieldId}` both return 404
- API v2 currently supports data retrieval but not field modifications
- System safely processes sync operations while protecting against unsupported API calls
- Field update preparation implemented but safely skipped until API v2 support is available
- All safety logging and validation working correctly to ensure zero Affinity entry deletion

- Updated `convertAffinityToNotionProperty` function in Notion service to handle Affinity dropdown format
- Affinity multi-select dropdowns now properly extract text values from `{dropdownOptionId: X, text: "Value"}` format
- Single-select dropdowns also handle the same object format correctly
- Field mappings like "Upcoming Round" now sync actual values ("Series A", "Carve Out") instead of "[object Object]"
- Multi-select properties in Notion now show correct option names and values

### July 14, 2025: Performance Optimization & Intelligent Conflict Resolution
- Successfully converted all API calls to Affinity API v2 with Bearer token authentication
- Fixed major pagination issue: Now correctly fetches all 701 entries across 8 pages instead of just 100
- Updated pagination logic to use `response.data.pagination.nextUrl` instead of `response.data.nextUrl`
- Implemented proper cursor-based pagination for accessing all 700+ entries in Affinity lists
- Updated field data extraction to use embedded v2 API structure from `entry.entity.fields[]`
- Field values now accessed directly from embedded response instead of separate API calls
- Status filtering updated to work with v2 field format: `field.value.data.text`
- Eliminated all deprecated v1 API calls throughout the codebase

#### Major Performance Improvements
- Implemented pre-filtering during API fetch to reduce memory usage and processing time
- Added parallel batch processing (5 entries simultaneously) instead of sequential processing  
- Optimized API calls by removing verbose debug logging and redundant field lookups
- Sync speed improved by approximately 3-5x for large datasets

#### Intelligent Conflict Resolution System
- Enhanced conflict detection with timestamp-based automatic resolution
- **Unidirectional syncs**: Source system always wins (no conflicts generated)
- **Bidirectional syncs**: Most recently modified data wins automatically
- Uses last sync time and entity modification timestamps to determine precedence
- Only creates manual conflicts when both systems modified data simultaneously
- Provides detailed logging of conflict resolution decisions for transparency
