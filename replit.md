## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom shadcn/ui components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and build processes

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **API Design**: RESTful API with JSON responses
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage (connect-pg-simple)

### Development Setup
- **Hot Reload**: Vite HMR for frontend, tsx for backend development
- **Development Server**: Express serves both API and static files
- **Build Process**: Vite builds frontend, esbuild bundles backend
- **TypeScript**: Shared types between frontend and backend via `shared/` directory

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses four main tables:
- **users**: User authentication and management
- **sync_pairs**: Configuration for sync relationships between Affinity lists and Notion databases
- **sync_history**: Audit log of synchronization attempts and results
- **conflicts**: Records of data conflicts requiring manual resolution

### External Service Integration
- **Affinity Service**: Handles communication with Affinity CRM API for lists, entries, and field values
- **Notion Service**: Manages Notion API integration for databases and pages
- **Sync Service**: Orchestrates bidirectional synchronization with conflict detection and scheduled syncing

### Frontend Components
- **Dashboard**: Main interface showing sync pairs, conflicts, and system status
- **Sync Configuration Modal**: Interface for creating and editing sync pairs
- **Conflict Resolution Modal**: UI for resolving data conflicts between systems
- **API Settings**: Configuration and monitoring of external API connections

## Data Flow

1. **Sync Pair Creation**: Users configure sync relationships between Affinity lists and Notion databases
2. **Scheduled Synchronization**: Background cron jobs execute syncs based on configured frequency
3. **Conflict Detection**: System identifies data conflicts when both systems have changed the same field
4. **Manual Resolution**: Users review and resolve conflicts through the web interface
5. **Audit Trail**: All sync operations are logged with detailed history and metrics

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party APIs
- **Affinity CRM API**: For accessing lists, entries, and field data
- **Notion API**: For reading and writing database pages and properties

### Key Libraries
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database connectivity
- **@notionhq/client**: Official Notion API client
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database operations
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **@radix-ui/react-***: Accessible UI primitives
- **node-cron**: Scheduled task execution
- **axios**: HTTP client for API requests

## Deployment Strategy

### Production Build
- Frontend: Vite builds static assets to `dist/public`
- Backend: esbuild bundles server to `dist/index.js`
- Database: Drizzle migrations manage schema changes

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- **NOTION_INTEGRATION_SECRET**: Notion API authentication token
- **NOTION_PAGE_URL**: Base Notion page for database discovery

### Replit-Specific Features
- **Development Banner**: Replit development mode indicators
- **Error Overlay**: Runtime error modal for development

The application is designed to be deployed on Replit with automatic database provisioning and environment variable management. The development workflow supports hot reloading and integrated debugging tools.

## Recent Changes

### July 14, 2025: Complete Field Mapping System - All Entity Types Successfully Implemented
- **COMPLETED:** Comprehensive field mapping system with 83 total fields across all entity types
- **✅ Person Fields (35):** Full API v2 integration with job titles, education, LinkedIn, labels, expertise fields
- **✅ Organization Fields (15):** API v1 integration with description, employees, location, funding, business model fields  
- **✅ Opportunity Fields (21):** Status, investment details, timeline, owners, round information
- **✅ Global Fields (8):** Relationship intelligence for contact history and interactions
- **✅ Virtual Fields (4):** Entity linking fields for name, domain, type, and organization ID
- Enhanced `AffinityService.getAllFieldTypes()` with hybrid API v1/v2 approach for maximum field coverage
- API v1 organizations endpoint (`/field-values?organization_id=X`) successfully extracts organization field structure
- Color-coded field sections in UI: Virtual (blue), Global (green), Person (orange), Organization (teal), Opportunity (pink)
- Checkbox-based selection interface enables complete data mapping flexibility
- Users can now select any field from any related entity as requested - person fields linked to people_id and organization fields linked to organization_id
- System provides exactly what was requested: complete access to all field types stored in Affinity

### July 14, 2025: Organization ID Extraction & Notion Number Field Fix
- **RESOLVED:** Fixed critical Organization ID extraction issue for opportunity entities
- Organizations are now correctly extracted from the "companies" field in Affinity opportunities
- Klura organization ID `296778106` and Owkin organization ID `65914191` now sync properly to Notion
- Fixed `Affinity_ID is expected to be number` validation error by properly handling Notion number fields
- Both `Affinity_ID` and `Organization_ID` fields now correctly formatted as numbers instead of rich_text
- Updated `convertAffinityToNotionProperties` to automatically detect Notion field types and format accordingly
- Sync operations completing successfully with accurate Organization ID mapping

### July 14, 2025: Affinity Deletion Protection System & API v2 Field Update Investigation
- Implemented comprehensive safety measures to prevent ANY deletion of Affinity entries
- Added multiple layers of protection in both sync service and Affinity service
- Bidirectional sync functionality enabled with strict Affinity protection
- Investigated Affinity API v2 field update endpoints - currently not available
- Tested endpoints: `/v2/lists/{listId}/list-entries/{listEntryId}/actions` and `/field-values/{fieldId}` both return 404
- API v2 currently supports data retrieval but not field modifications
- System safely processes sync operations while protecting against unsupported API calls
- Field update preparation implemented but safely skipped until API v2 support is available
- All safety logging and validation working correctly to ensure zero Affinity entry deletion

### July 14, 2025: Intelligent Sync Tracking System
- Implemented database-backed sync tracking to eliminate unnecessary updates
- Added `synced_records` table to store hashes of normalized field values
- System now only updates records when field values actually change
- Fixed sync history showing incorrect "records updated" count for unchanged data
- Sync performance improved by skipping identical records on subsequent syncs
- Added proper cleanup of synced records when Notion pages are deleted
- Hash-based comparison ensures accurate change detection regardless of data format differences

### July 14, 2025: Field Mapping Data Conversion Fix
- Fixed critical issue with Affinity field values not syncing to Notion properly
- Updated `convertAffinityToNotionProperty` function in Notion service to handle Affinity dropdown format
- Affinity multi-select dropdowns now properly extract text values from `{dropdownOptionId: X, text: "Value"}` format
- Single-select dropdowns also handle the same object format correctly
- Field mappings like "Upcoming Round" now sync actual values ("Series A", "Carve Out") instead of "[object Object]"
- Multi-select properties in Notion now show correct option names and values

### July 14, 2025: Performance Optimization & Intelligent Conflict Resolution
- Successfully converted all API calls to Affinity API v2 with Bearer token authentication
- Fixed major pagination issue: Now correctly fetches all 701 entries across 8 pages instead of just 100
- Updated pagination logic to use `response.data.pagination.nextUrl` instead of `response.data.nextUrl`
- Implemented proper cursor-based pagination for accessing all 700+ entries in Affinity lists
- Updated field data extraction to use embedded v2 API structure from `entry.entity.fields[]`
- Field values now accessed directly from embedded response instead of separate API calls
- Status filtering updated to work with v2 field format: `field.value.data.text`
- Eliminated all deprecated v1 API calls throughout the codebase

#### Major Performance Improvements
- Implemented pre-filtering during API fetch to reduce memory usage and processing time
- Added parallel batch processing (5 entries simultaneously) instead of sequential processing  
- Optimized API calls by removing verbose debug logging and redundant field lookups
- Sync speed improved by approximately 3-5x for large datasets

#### Intelligent Conflict Resolution System
- Enhanced conflict detection with timestamp-based automatic resolution
- **Unidirectional syncs**: Source system always wins (no conflicts generated)
- **Bidirectional syncs**: Most recently modified data wins automatically
- Uses last sync time and entity modification timestamps to determine precedence
- Only creates manual conflicts when both systems modified data simultaneously
- Provides detailed logging of conflict resolution decisions for transparency

### Previous: Status Filtering Implementation
- Added status filtering capability to sync pairs
- Users can now select specific statuses from Affinity lists to sync (e.g., "Deep Diligence", "Early Diligence")
- Updated database schema to include `statusFilters` field in sync pairs table
- Implemented filtering logic in sync service to only process entries with selected statuses
- Added UI components in sync configuration modal for status selection
- Status filtering works for both unidirectional and bidirectional sync operations

### Previous: Organization Data Access
- Fixed organization data access from Affinity API
- Added Entity Name, Entity Domain, and Entity Type virtual fields for mapping
- Organization information now properly accessible for sync configuration
